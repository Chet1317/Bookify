# Bookify

## Description
Bookify is a convenient web application designed to allow users to research and discover the ideal venue for whatever they are looking for. Whether you're looking for top reviewed barbershops, the cheapest auto repair shop or the top new restaurant in town, Bookify will not only find it for you but book it for you as well.

Bookify is simple to use, just search for what you're interested in and all the information you need will populate. You will be given addresses, images, reviews and for the options presented; you will also be given a featured option on the business page for i.e. a restaurant that is trending near you. Once you've made a decision, Bookify will give you the option to book that service directly through the app.

## User Story

We are Spartans; a development team from Toronto, Canada. We developed the idea for Bookify with convenience as our top priority. In today’s world, especially since the events of the global pandemic, it is vital to have instant information and updates on the places you are visiting. Having a one-stop-shop app to help people was our driving force.

## Motivation

We wanted to have a positive impact on the world with this powerful new app. With Bookify we can help connect consumers with businesses through minimal contact and precision bookings. As a result, we created a one-stop-shop platform so both businesses and consumers didn’t have to go back and forth between apps like Yelp and Booksy.

During this unprecedented time, we wanted to ensure we can help both businesses and consumers generate revenue at a faster pace with an easy-to-use platform to assist them in their day-to-day lives.

## Usage
 
In order to use Bookify effectively, please access the deployed application at: INSERT LINK HERE and follow the instructions below.

New users will be required to "Register", and will be prompted to input everything from business name to category to location which will contribute to the basic aspect of their profile. In order to effectively be featured on the app, businesses must correctly identify what cateogry they are to be featured in along with services and booking times and locations they are registering.

For consumers, registration is mandatory to benefit from the app. Basic user registration is required consisting of essential information such as name, age, location, e-mail, etc.
